## Speed Maths
*A fun, hands-on way to hone the maths skills you need the most*

Think of this project as a mixture of Mathletics Live, and Monkeytype. Through repitition and variation, players will be able to steadily improve upon their fundamental mental maths skills, including (but not limited to):
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
- Fraction and Ratio Simplification
- Exponents and Square Roots
- A combination of everything!

The primary concept is simple: players are presented a question, and they answer it as fast as they can. Various modes will be available:
- Marathon: Last as long as possible, as you answer increasingly difficult questions with a speedy time limit
- Zen: Choose a difficulty, and answer as many questions as you can within 60 seconds
- Sprint: Choose a difficulty, and answer 10/20/50/100 questions as fast as you can

Find a particular type of question you struggle with? Adjust the categories of questions you'll be asked to challenge yourself, or hone your best skills!

All of this, packaged in a neat, minimalistic UI with a versatile theming system!
